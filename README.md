# Vue decoupled Front-end GUI

A demonstration Front-end GUI for a REST API, managing a simple set of CRUD operations. 

## Technologies used:
* Vue.js
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Operations:
GUI input sends request methods and data to the [API](https://github.com/bauerindustries/todos-rest-api) endpoints, to achieve the following:
* Read existing to-do items
* Create new to-do item/s
* Update existing to-do item/s
* Delete to-do item/s

## Hosting:
You can see this front-end running [here](https://cute-peony-3eb499.netlify.app) on Netlify.

The API is running [here](https://todos-rest-api-demo.onrender.com/todos).

The MongoDB database is hosted on MongoDB's Atlas Database.

## Requirements:
* The data() object variable *todo_API_URI* must be pointed to the URL of the API 

## The API:
For more details on the workings of the API, please see the repository [Readme](https://github.com/bauerindustries/todos-rest-api).
